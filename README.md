# ExploratoryGraph
The assignment here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. 

The plots are reconstructed with the codes attached which were constructed using the base plotting system.

First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/PaiAshwini/ExploratoryGraph

The dataset https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
should be extracted to a folder called Data directory.

The graphs will be saved in the working directory.
